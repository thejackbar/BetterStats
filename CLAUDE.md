# BetterStats — Claude Session Notes

## Server Deploy Command

Always use the **central** compose file. Never use `/srv/docker/betterstats/docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
git -C /srv/docker/betterstats pull origin main && \
docker compose -f /srv/docker/docker-compose.yaml build --no-cache betterstats-frontend betterstats-backend && \
docker compose -f /srv/docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d --force-recreate betterstats-frontend betterstats-backend
```

- `--no-cache` on the build step is required to avoid stale Docker layer cache
- Only rebuild the two betterstats services, not the whole stack
- nginx-proxy-manager routes `betterstats.cricket` → `betterstats-frontend` container on `docker-shared-net` (apex is the canonical domain; `www.betterstats.cricket` should 301-redirect to it)
- The backend container name is `betterstats-backend` — this is the correct hostname in `nginx.conf`

## Public Domain

The canonical public domain is **`https://betterstats.cricket`** (no `www`). The old `betterstats.bltbox.com` domain is retired.

- Hardcoded references live in `frontend/src/hooks/usePageMeta.js` (`BASE_URL`) and `frontend/index.html` (`og:url`) — keep both on the apex domain.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` should be `https://betterstats.cricket` in the server `.env`, but note CORS is dormant in practice: the frontend calls the API via a same-origin relative `/api` path, so cross-origin checks never fire. Updating it is hygiene, not a functional requirement.
- Any new build/config that references the public URL must point to `betterstats.cricket`.

## Version Numbers

Bump version in **`frontend/src/version.js`** (`SITE_VERSION`) with every change — `Navbar.jsx` re-exports it for backwards compat:
- Small fix: `+0.0.0.1`
- Medium change: `+0.0.1`
- Large change: `+0.1`

## Branch

Active development branch: `claude/fix-historical-game-data-QEN3b`
Push to this branch AND to `main` via MCP after each change.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL (`backend/`)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (`frontend/`)
- **API**: Grassroots API proxy (`grassrootsapiproxy.cricket.com.au`) — season-aggregate stats freely accessible; game-level paths exist but the proxy's upstream API key is restricted
- `jsconfig=eccn:true` is a ServiceStack formatting flag, NOT an API key

## Data Source Topology (May 2026 investigation)

Cricket Australia hosts club cricket data across **two separate backends**, both reached via `play.cricket.com.au`:

1. **PlayHQ** (post-migration, ~2023+): GUID-keyed. Reachable via:
   - Partner REST API `api.playhq.com/v1/...` — public key only returns ~3 seasons (Summer 23/24, 24/25, 25/26). `/teams` is 401 with public key. `/grades` (org-level) is 404. `/v2/games/{id}/summary` works for IDs in this universe.
   - Public GraphQL `api.playhq.com/graphql` — `discoverGame` works for current games, `discoverGradeFixture` and `discoverTeamFixture` 500 with "Bolt adapter map not found" (require session/cookie auth the website holds). Schema introspection disabled.

2. **MyCricket / Pulselive Play Community** (legacy / pre-migration): GUID-keyed throughout (different namespace from PlayHQ). Data confirmed to reach back to at least 1975. Reachable via the same `grassrootsapiproxy.cricket.com.au` host we already use — just on a different path prefix than the proxy's restricted endpoints:
   - **`/scores/grades/{grade_id}/matches`** — all matches in a grade. ✓ unauthenticated. **Primary match discovery path** — grade_id is the same UUID as `grades.id` in our DB, works for all seasons including pre-2000. Confirmed 200 OK for a 1996 Applecross 8th Grade game.
   - **`/scores/teams/{team_id}/matches`** — list of matches a team played that season. ✓ unauthenticated. Secondary/fallback; team IDs require a fixturesladders call first.
   - **`/scores/matches/{match_id}?responseModifier=includeScorecard`** — full scorecard (batting, bowling, fielding, fall-of-wickets). ✓ unauthenticated. Returns **HTTP 204 No Content** for post-migration PlayHQ-namespace IDs, which is a clean "not mine" signal.
   - **`/fixturesladders/grades/{grade_id}/ladders`** — grade ladder (win/loss/points standings). ✓ unauthenticated 200 OK. Useful for future ladder feature — not yet synced.
   - **`/fixturesladders/grades/{grade_id}`** — grade metadata. ✓ unauthenticated 200 OK.
   - `participantId` in the response **is the same GUID as `players.id` in our DB** — no extra mapping needed.
   - The restricted paths (`/fixturesladders/games/{id}`, `/participants/games/{id}/batting`, `/scorecards/...`) all return `403 "API key does not have access"`. **Don't try those.** The `/scores/*` path is the one that works.
   - `apiv2.cricket.com.au` — has Swagger UI at `/`, OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`. Looks promising at first glance but is the **international** stats API (Ashes, BBL, Sheffield Shield) — does NOT contain club cricket data. Skip.
   - `api.playcommunity.pulselive.com` — verified `/registration` only; broader scope unknown.
   - `crm-communitycricket-cdn.cricket.com.au` — referenced by the bundle, scope unknown.

   **How to find the real API call**: the play.cricket.com.au website is a CSR Pulselive SPA (`window.API_ACCOUNT = 'playcommunity'`, bundle at `/resources/playcricket/v1.28.6/scripts/bundle-es.min.js`). HTML is just a shell. Anonymous server-side curls of `ca.playhq.com/*` and JS bundles get 403'd. Network-tab the request from a real browser load to recover the URL — that's how we found `/scores/*`.

3. **Pagination quirk**: PlayHQ's `links.next` is sometimes returned forever even when the data is exhausted (observed paginating past page 1100 on a single grade). Our pagination loops cap at MAX_PAGES=200 and stop on the first short batch — never trust `links.next` alone.

4. **Org duplication trap**: `upsert_organisation` keys on whatever `id` is passed in, so calling sync with a PlayHQ UUID after the org was already created with a Grassroots GUID creates a duplicate row (one with `playhq_id=NULL` matching the other org's `id`). Detected May 2026 for Applecross, cleaned up via direct DELETE. Worth a defensive check in `upsert_organisation`.

## Sync Architecture

### Admin UI button names (Sync Actions card)

The three buttons on `/admin/sync` map to backend endpoints as follows. When
the user says one of the UI names, this is what they mean:

| UI button             | Backend route                                  | What it does                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sync Now**          | `POST /organisations/{id}/sync`                | Pull latest games & stats. Safe to run anytime — the weekly job.    |
| **Fix Missing Totals**| backfill aggregates endpoint (`/club-admin/...`) | Recomputes `player_season_stats` from existing per-game rows. No CA fetch. Use when a player shows 0 matches/runs despite having scorecards. |
| **Full Rebuild**      | `POST /club-admin/hard-refresh`                | Wipes per-game tables and re-pulls everything from CA. Slow (hour+). Use after sync-logic changes. |

(Renamed Apr–May 2026; old labels were "Sync" / "Backfill Aggregates" /
"Hard Refresh". Internal endpoint names and the `kind` field on `sync_runs`
are unchanged.)

- **Full sync** (`POST /organisations/{id}/sync`) / **Hard refresh** (`POST /club-admin/hard-refresh`): scheduled weekly + on-demand. Two passes:
  1. **Grassroots aggregate** (`playhq_client.get_*_stats`) — season totals for all 52 seasons. Source of `player_season_stats`.
  2. **Grassroots scores** (`grassroots_scores_client` + `sync_grassroots_game_level_data`) — game-level scorecards confirmed back to at least 1975. Iterates grades from DB (all seasons, all grades), calls `/scores/grades/{grade_id}/matches` for each to get match IDs, fetches `/scores/matches/{id}?includeScorecard` for each. Skips PHQ-namespace IDs that 204. Per-game session pattern to avoid async session deadlock. Uses `session.get(Grade, ...)` to avoid stale-cache FK violations. No longer depends on fixturesladders for discovery, so pre-2000 seasons are fully covered.
- **PlayHQ Partner game-level sync** is **removed** from `sync_organisation` (May 2026 audit). The public API key only exposed ~3 seasons of history vs Grassroots's 50+, AND because the same physical match has different UUIDs in PHQ vs Grassroots, running both produced duplicate batting rows. `sync_game_level_data`, `_backfill_player_playhq_ids`, and `process_game_updated_webhook` were deleted from sync.py — see git history if ever needed again.
- **Per-player deep sync**: `deep_sync_player()` — admin-triggered, still present but pre-dates the Grassroots unlock. Calls PlayHQ Partner API; only covers ~3 recent seasons. Low value now that Grassroots covers everything including 25/26.
- **Sync runs persisted** in `sync_runs` table (migration 005). `update_sync_run` and `finish_sync_run` MERGE stats into the existing row (don't replace) so sub-phases accumulate. Stale `running` rows are marked `error` on backend startup.
- **`owns_run` gotcha**: inside `sync_organisation`, `owns_run = run_id is None`. So when a caller passes `run_id` (e.g. the hard-refresh handler that calls `start_sync_run` itself), sync_organisation only ever calls `update_sync_run` on success and NEVER `finish_sync_run`. The **caller** is responsible for finishing the run. The hard-refresh handler (`club_admin.py:_run`) used to only call `finish_sync_run` in the exception branch, so every successful hard-refresh sat at `running` forever — fixed May 2026.
- **Merge-aware GR sync** (May 2026, v3.0.2): `sync_grassroots_game_level_data` now builds a `merged_away: removed_player_id → keep_player_id` map from `merge_logs WHERE undone_at IS NULL` (with transitive resolution) during discovery. Each of the five `participantId` consumers (batting, bowling, fielding, fall-of-wickets, derived partnerships) checks `known_player_ids` first and falls back to `merged_away` before skipping. Without this, scorecards referencing a previously-merged player_id silently dropped those stats, leaving the kept player short on innings/wickets/catches/fall-of-wickets.
- **Aggregate-sync merge map** (v3.0.2.1) was previously NOT filtering `merge_logs` by `undone_at IS NULL` AND was building only a single-hop redirect dict. Two consequences:
  1. Stale entries (e.g. a merge that was reversed by a later re-merge in the opposite direction) poisoned the map — observed for Cooper Jnr (`92F`) where a 04:59 merge `KEEP=09c REMOVED=92F` redirected his aggregate stats to `09c` (which no longer exists), silently dropping every season except those keyed under a different ID that resolved cleanly. Symptom: per-game `batting_innings` correct (different sync path), but `player_season_stats` summary showed only 3 seasons.
  2. Multi-step merges (A→B→C) would redirect A to B only; if B was later merged away, the insert hit the safety net and got dropped.
  Fix: filter by `undone_at IS NULL` and resolve transitively with cycle break — same pattern as the GR sync function. Manual cleanup also needed for already-poisoned rows: `UPDATE merge_logs SET undone_at = NOW() WHERE undone_at IS NULL AND removed_player_id IN (SELECT id FROM players)` to mark entries where the "removed" player is back in the players table.
- **"Absent" / "DNB" dismissals aren't innings** (v3.0.2.2): GR scorecards mark a batter "Absent" or "Did Not Bat" with `dismissalTypeId > 0` but no ball faced. CA's aggregate API correctly excludes these, but our per-game parser used to insert `batting_innings` rows for them — causing per-game counts to over-shoot aggregate by 1-2 rows for any player who's ever been Absent. Now filtered in both the batting-row insert and `_derive_partnerships_grassroots` (since absent batters were never at the crease). Existing over-counted rows need a one-time `DELETE FROM batting_innings WHERE dismissal_type IN ('absent', 'did not bat', 'dnb')` to clean up.
- **GR scorecard team-name parsing**: `isHome` lives on `matchSummary.teams`, NOT on the top-level `teams` array. Reading from the wrong field is silently OK (no error) but produces empty `home_team`.

## PlayHQ Partner API — May 2026 Audit

**Finding**: Grassroots `/scores/*` IS returning scorecards for recent seasons (25/26 confirmed). The "204 for post-migration games" gap is minimal in practice — Applecross's May 2026 hard refresh got 4204 GR matches, 3947 new games, across all seasons including recent ones. The Partner sync was not needed.

**What was removed (May 2026)**:
- `sync_game_level_data()` — the disabled PHQ Partner game-level sync (was called with `all_games=[]`)
- `_backfill_player_playhq_ids()` — PHQ ID backfill from game appearances, never called in sync flow
- `process_game_updated_webhook()` — empty stub

**What was kept (still live)**:
- `deep_sync_player()` in sync.py — admin-triggered per-player resync via Partner API; low value now, but still callable from admin UI
- `suggest_phq_ids()` in sync.py — powers the "PHQ ID Match" admin page (`/admin/phq-match`)
- `playhq_partner_client.py` — still used by games router (live scorecard view for the rare Partner-only games), records router, and organisations router
- `playhq_id` on Player/Organisation models — retained as nullable legacy field; harmless and used for display in admin

**Data layer summary**:
- Season-aggregate stats (`player_season_stats`): Grassroots aggregate API → all 52 seasons ✓
- Game-level stats (`batting_innings`, `bowling_spells`, `fielding_stats`): Grassroots `/scores/*` → all seasons including 25/26 ✓ (204 gap is minimal)
- Live scorecard view for Partner-only games: PlayHQ Partner API via games router (rarely hit)

## Key Notes

- PlayHQ public game summary API is "not applicable to Cricket" — no scorecards without a partner JWT
- PostgreSQL `ORDER BY year DESC` defaults to NULLS FIRST — always use `.nullslast()`
- API field names: `bowlingEconomyRate`, `fieldingTotalCatches`, no `bowlingOvers` (derive from `bowlingBalls`)
- `Season.year` is NULL when Grassroots doesn't return `startDate` — extract from name (`"Summer 2010/11"` → `2010`) as a fallback
- `stats["players"]` in sync is misleading — it's `len(player_data)` summed across seasons, i.e. player-season records, not unique players. With 52 seasons × ~3.4 avg seasons/player ≈ 5326 (which Applecross actually shows). Worth renaming to `player_seasons`.

## May 2026 Historical Data Fix — Resolution Log

**Problem**: post-migration, every historical game had blank `home_team`/`away_team` AND Jack Barendse had ~280 batting rows instead of the expected 200. Two root causes.

**Fix 1 — duplicate batting rows from running both sync paths**:
PlayHQ Partner game-level sync was disabled in `sync_organisation` (see Sync Architecture above). Same physical match has different UUIDs in PHQ vs Grassroots; the existing-game skip is UUID-based; running both produced duplicate batting rows.

**Fix 2 — `isHome` lookup on wrong field**:
GR scorecard parser was reading `isHome` from the top-level `teams` array — silently absent, so every game's `home_team` was empty. The flag actually lives on `matchSummary.teams`. Fixed and re-parses cleanly.

**Verification (Applecross, post-wipe + hard refresh)**:
- games: 3957 (was 4418 — old number was bloated by PHQ/GR duplicates)
- batting_innings: 41423, bowling_spells: 26862, fielding_stats: 15495
- games with empty home_team: **0**
- Barendse, Jack: **200 batting / 168 bowling / 93 fielding** ✓

**Fix 3 — successful hard-refresh stuck at `running`** (discovered during the verification of Fixes 1+2):
`sync_organisation` only calls `finish_sync_run` when it owns the run (i.e. when called without a `run_id`). The hard-refresh handler owns the run itself but only called `finish_sync_run` in its exception branch. Fixed `club_admin.py::hard_refresh_org._run` to call `finish_sync_run(run_id, stats)` after a successful `await sync_organisation(...)`.

## Notification Centre (v7.7.3, May 2026)

Bell icon in the AdminLayout header + drop-down panel that auto-opens on login when there's something new.

**Architecture** — no dedicated notifications table:
- `User` model gains `last_notification_seen_at TIMESTAMP` and `last_seen_app_version TEXT` (migration `029`).
- Three endpoints under `/club-admin/notifications/`:
  - `GET /count` — cheap badge poll (runs every 60s). Counts sync runs + milestones + pending sync requests since last seen. Returns `{ unseen_count, last_seen_version }`.
  - `GET /summary` — full data fetched only when the modal opens. Returns sync runs, new milestones, upcoming milestones (top 5), pending count.
  - `POST /seen` — sets `last_notification_seen_at = now()` and `last_seen_app_version = <passed version>`.
- "Since last visit" window defaults to 14 days if user has never dismissed notifications.

**Feature Changelog** (`frontend/src/data/changelog.js`):
- Static JS array, newest entry first. Each entry has `{ version, date, title, items[] }`.
- `SITE_VERSION` moved to `frontend/src/version.js` — `Navbar.jsx` re-exports it for backwards compat.
- The bell computes `newChangelogCount` (entries with version > `last_seen_version`) client-side and adds it to the backend `unseen_count` for the badge.
- Auto-open on login fires if `unseen_count > 0 || any changelog entry is newer than last_seen_version`.

**Adding a new changelog entry**: bump `SITE_VERSION` in `src/version.js`, then prepend an entry in `src/data/changelog.js` with the same version string.

**Open follow-ups worth investigating**:
- `deep_sync_player` (admin-triggered per-player resync via PHQ Partner API) still has a UI surface but is low value now that Grassroots covers all seasons including 25/26. Could be retired or repointed at GR. Low priority — no data pollution.
- Season-alias URL redirects: visiting `/yearbook/{alias_season_id}` still loads the alias's hidden yearbook record + alias-only stats. The stats queries auto-expand when visiting the canonical URL, but no redirect from alias URL → canonical URL exists yet. Old bookmarks to merged-away seasons are the corner case.
